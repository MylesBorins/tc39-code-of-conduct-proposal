## TC39 Code of Conduct

Like the technical community as a whole, the various JS Foundation teams and communities are made up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers from all over the world, working on every aspect of the mission - including mentorship, teaching, and connecting people.

Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to. This code applies equally to founders, mentors and those seeking help and guidance.

This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the JS Foundation and its projects. This includes IRC, the mailing lists, the issue trackers, JS Foundation events, and any other forums created by the project teams which the community uses for communication. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them.

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing [conduct@js.foundation][]. For more details, please see our [Reporting Guidelines][].

### Be friendly and patient

We understand that everyone has different levels of experience or knowledge in many diverse fields, be it technical or non-technical in nature. We also have areas of knowledge we are eager to expand; we want to be a community where people can not only contribute, but feel comfortable to ask questions as well and learn along the way. If someone says something wrong, or says something accidentally offensive, respond with patience and try to keep it polite and civil. Remember that we all were newbies at one point.

### Be welcoming

We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

### Be considerate

Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you make will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.

### Be respectful

Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the JS Foundation community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the JS Foundation community.

### Be careful in the words that you choose

We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Violent threats or language directed against another person.
* Discriminatory jokes and language.
* Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
* Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
* Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
* Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.

### When we disagree, try to understand why

Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and JS Foundation projects are no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we're different. The strength of the JS Foundation comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

## Reporting

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct we ask that you report it to the JS Foundation by emailing [conduct@js.foundation][]. **All reports will be kept confidential.** In some cases we may determine that a public statement will need to be made. If that's the case, the identities of all victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

### If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate law enforcement first

If you are unsure what law enforcement agency is appropriate, please include this in your report and we will attempt to notify them.

In your report please include:

*   Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up).
*   Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well.
*   When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
*   Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger) please include a link. Screenshots can be useful in the case something is edited or deleted before action is taken.
*   Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
*   If you believe this incident is ongoing.
*   Any other information you believe we should have.

### What happens after you file a report?

Reports will receive urgent and immediate attention from the Code of Conduct Committee. Please refer to the [Enforcement Manual][] for the complete information on how reports will be processed. Though normally considered an internal document, it has been published in full in the interest of transparency.

### Appealing

Only permanent resolutions (such as bans) may be appealed. To appeal a decision of the committee, contact the JS Foundation President and Executive Director at [executive@js.foundation][] with your appeal and they will review the case.

## Enforcement

This is the enforcement manual followed by JS Foundation's Code of Conduct Committee. It's used when we respond to an issue to make sure we're consistent and fair. It should be considered an internal document, but we're publishing it publicly in the interest of transparency.

### The Code of Conduct Committee

All responses to reports of conduct violations will be managed by a [Code of Conduct Committee][] ("the committee").

The JS Foundation's Board of Directors ("the board") will establish this committee, comprised of at least three members. One member will be designated chair of the committee and will be responsible for all reports back to the board. The board will review membership on a regular basis.

### How the Committee Will Respond to Reports

When a report is sent to the committee they will immediately reply to the report to confirm receipt. This reply must be sent within 24 hours, and the committee should strive to respond more quickly than that.

See the [Reporting Guidelines][] for details of what reports should contain. If a report doesn't contain enough information, the committee will obtain all relevant data before acting. The committee is empowered to act on the JS Foundation's behalf in contacting any individuals involved to get a more complete account of events.

The committee will then review the incident and determine, to the best of their ability:

*   What happened.
*   Whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation.
*   Who, if anyone, was the bad actor.
*   Whether this is an ongoing situation, and if there is a threat to anyone's physical safety.

This information will be collected in writing, and whenever possible the committee's deliberations will be recorded and retained (e.g. IRC transcripts, email discussions, or recorded voice conversations).

The committee should aim to have a resolution agreed upon within one week. In the event that a resolution can't be determined in that time, the committee will respond to the reporter(s) with an update and projected timeline for resolution.

### Acting Unilaterally

If the act is ongoing (such as someone engaging in harassment in #jquery on IRC), or involves a threat to anyone's safety (e.g. threats of violence), any committee member or moderator may act immediately (before reaching consensus) to end the situation. In ongoing situations, any moderator may at their discretion employ any of the tools available to the committee, including bans and blocks.

If the incident involves physical danger, any member of the committee may -- and should -- act unilaterally to protect safety. This can include contacting law enforcement (or other local personnel) and speaking on behalf of the JS Foundation.

In situations where an individual committee member acts unilaterally, they must report their actions to the committee for review within 24 hours.

### Resolutions

The committee must agree on a resolution by consensus. If the committee cannot reach consensus and deadlocks for over a week, the committee will turn the matter over to the board for resolution.

Possible responses may include:

*   Taking no further action (if we determine no violation occurred).
*   A private reprimand from the committee to the individual(s) involved. In this case, the committee chair will deliver that reprimand to the individual(s) over email, cc'ing the committee.
*   A public reprimand. In this case, the committee chair will deliver that reprimand in the same venue that the violation occurred (e.g. in IRC for an IRC violation; email for an email violation). The committee may choose to publish this message elsewhere for posterity.
*   An imposed vacation (e.g. asking someone to "take a week off" from a mailing list or IRC). The committee chair will communicate this "vacation" to the individual(s). They'll be asked to take this vacation voluntarily, but if they don't agree then a temporary ban may be imposed to enforce this vacation.
*   A permanent or temporary ban from some or all JS Foundation spaces (including mailing lists and IRC). The committee will maintain records of all such bans so that they may be reviewed in the future, extended to new JS Foundation fora, or otherwise maintained.
*   A request for a public or private apology. The chair will deliver this request. The committee may, if it chooses, attach "strings" to this request: for example, the committee may ask a violator to apologize in order to retain his or her membership on a mailing list.

Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, the committee will contact the original reporter and any other affected parties and explain the proposed resolution. The committee will ask if this resolution is acceptable, and must note feedback for the record. However, the committee is not required to act on this feedback.

Finally the committee will make a report for the JS Foundation Board (as well as the project teams in the event of an ongoing resolution, such as a ban).

The committee will never publicly discuss the issue; all public statements will be made by the JS Foundation Board.

### Conflicts of Interest

In the event of any conflict of interest a committee member must immediately notify the other members, and recuse themselves if necessary.
